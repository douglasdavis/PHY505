\section{Previous Experimental Efforts}
There exists considerable experimental evidence for the existence of a fourth neutrino at energy scales in the eV range. The sources for evidence include the short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments LSND (Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector) at Los Alamos~\cite{LSND}, and MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment) at Fermilab~\cite{mini1,mini2}. There is also the reactor neutrino anomaly~\cite{reactor_anom1}, and also in the radioactive source calibrations for the solar neutrino experiments GALLEX~\cite{gallex1,gallex2} and SAGE~\cite{sage1,sage2}.
\subsection{LSND}
The LSND experiment was developed to search for $\overline{\nu}_\mu \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_e$ oscillations. The source of $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ was the decay at rest (DAR) of $\mu^+$. LSND used a proton beam on a target to produce pions. The decay chain was as follows:
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \pi^+ &\rightarrow \mu^+  \nu_\mu, \\
    \mu^+ &\rightarrow e^+  \nu_e  \overline{\nu}_\mu.
  \end{split}
\end{align}
The $\overline{\nu}_e$ events were detected through the interaction:
\begin{align}
  \overline{\nu}_e  p \rightarrow e^+ n,
\end{align}
inside of a large Cherenkov detector filled with liquid scintillator, utilizing 1280 phototubes. Figure~\ref{fig:lsnd_miniboone}L shows the excess of $\overline{\nu}_e$ events observed by LSND. The observation was $87.9\pm 22.4\pm6$ events over expected background. Their final result claimed the existence of $\overline{\nu}_\mu\rightarrow\overline{\nu}_e$ oscillations at $\Delta m^2 \sim 1\text{ eV}$ with 3.8$\sigma$. This is in heavy conflict with the existing three light flavor neutrino model supported by atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation experiments, as well as measurements at LEP predicting $N=2.984\pm0.0082$ for weakly interacting neutrino flavors. Therefore, at least one ``sterile'' neutrino is required.

Black stars represent the MiniBooNE best fit points for $\Delta m^2$ and $\sin^22\theta$~\cite{mini2}.}

\end{figure*}
\subsection{MiniBooNE}
The MiniBooNE experiment was developed to answer the LSND anomaly. The MiniBooNE detector also used Cherenkov radiation with photomultiplier tubes as their tool for detecting neutrino interactions. The Booster neutrino beam at Fermilab was used to create a $\nu_\mu$ or $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ beam. Protons were accelerated to 8 GeV by the Booster accelerator and were then steered to a beryillium target where a magnetic focusing horn steered pions from the proton on target collisions down the beam line towards the detector; the pions would decay into muons and muon neutrinos between the horn and the detector. Changing the magnetic focusing horn mode allowed for a beam of mostly $\nu_\mu$ or mostly $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ (neutrino or anti neutrino modes). In neutrino mode $\pi^+$ were steered towards the detector, while $\pi^-$ were steered away; and the reverse for anti neutrino mode. This is to utilize the decays:
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \pi^+ &\rightarrow \mu^+\nu_\mu \\
    \pi^- &\rightarrow \mu^-\overline{\nu}_\mu  
  \end{split}
\end{align}
The full dataset from MiniBooNE was consistent with the LSND $\overline{\nu}_e$ excess, and therefore the sterile neutrino hypothesis survived. Figures~\ref{fig:lsnd_miniboone}C and \ref{fig:lsnd_miniboone}R show the electron excess and allowed oscillation regions from the MiniBooNE data, respectively.

The systematics of the MiniBooNE detector made it difficult to differentiate between $\pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and an electron in the detector; therefore, there is a large uncertainty in the total number of $\overline{\nu}_e$ events. It is also hypothesized that the neutrino flux from the Booster neutrino beam must be studied more rigorously.
\subsection{Reactor Anomaly}
There has been an effort to re-analyse short baseline reactor neutrino oscillation data using newer flux calculations. These calculations show the possibility of the disappearance of reactor $\overline{\nu}_e$.

\section{Current and Future Experimental Efforts}
Due to the number of anomalous results to date sterile neutrino searches have become popular research topics at the majority of contemporary neutrino experiments, both those currently running and those in the design and construction phases.

\subsection{Current Experiments}

\subsection{Current Experimental Results}


\subsubsection{MINOS/MINOS+}
The MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search) experiment ran from 2005 to 2012 and its wide-band fresh, MINOS+, has taking data since September 2013. The MINOS experiment is a long baseline style detector with a neutrino beam source and near detector at Fermilab and a far detector located in northern Minnesota. Though its primary physics goals lie in the area of neutrino oscillation measurements, MINOS and MINOS+ are now also running sterile neutrino analysis with their data. MINOS detects sterile neutrinos via their disappearance in neutral-current (NC) interactions, which are independent of the three known neutrino flavors and their oscillations, and in charged-current (CC) interactions differing from those predicted from the mixing of the three neutrinos of the standard model. The latest sterile neutrino results from the collaboration \cite{MINOS} now exclude a large majority of the LSND allowed phase space, Figure~\ref{fig:MINOS}. These exclusion limits are predicted to increase by up to a factor of 2 as MINOS+ continues to run.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{../figures/minos2.pdf}
  \caption{MINOS sterile neutrino exclusion limits~\cite{MINOS}. MINOS is now excluding (to the right of the red line) much of the LSND allowed phase space (shaded).}
  \label{fig:MINOS}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Super-Kamiokande}
The Super-Kamiokande experiment is a 22.5 kton water Cherenkov detector that looks at atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Their latest sterile neutrino analysis~\cite{SuperK} used a sterile vacuum fit to put limits on the mixing between $\nu_{\mu}$ and a sterile neutrino $\nu_4$, parameterized by $\left|U_{\mu 4}\right|^2 \approx sin^2 \theta_{24}$, Figure~\ref{fig:SuperK}. Super-K can not measure $\Delta m^{2}_{41}$ in this analysis however, so when comparing to MiniBooNE the Super-K result is just a straight line. The Super-K result is is consistent with the MiniBooNE exclusion, providing verification on at least part of the MiniBooNE excluded region.

\subsection{Future Experiments}
% Matt
While there are many future neutrino experiments in various stages of development, MicroBooNE and NOvA are the closest to producing new sterile neutrino results. As its name suggests, MicroBooNE is the larger follow up experiment to MiniBooNE. The MicroBooNE detector is an advanced time projection chamber with a 60 ton fiducial volume of liquid argon, and unlike MiniBooNE it will be able to distinguish between photons and electrons. It is widely expected that these significant improvements will allow MicroBooNE to resolve the MiniBooNE excess anomaly. The NOvA experiment is long baseline experiment that uses the same NuMI neutrino beam from Fermilab as MINOS and also has its far detector located in northern Minnesota. The 330 ton near and 14 kton far detectors are liquid scintillator designs located near the surface. NOvA's primary purpose is to make oscillation measurements, including potentially determining the ordering of the mass hierarchy, but will produce more sterile neutrino measurements as well.
